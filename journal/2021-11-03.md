# Happenings

I had trouble sleeping the night before. Not only is my sleep routine still impacted from events a few days prior, I also recently decided that I will be taking a 1 month break from weed; a little tolerance reset. I don't think I got any sleep, I basically just shut my eyes for 4 hours. At 7am I got out of bed and walked to my parents house where I have set up an office space, thought I doubted I'd be using it today. I was going there to simply get some privacy to endure the day. I end up watching some spoonyone videos, a little trip down memory lane. However, despite the copious amounts of caffeine I ingested I ended up sleeping on the couch between the hours of 2 and 5. My Mom arrived at the house as I was waking up and prepared food. We spoke for a bit while I ate and then she dove me home. All in all it was a rather uneventful day, I was tried and withdrawn for almost all of it. The highlight of my day was talking to my mom.
