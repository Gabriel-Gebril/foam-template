I don't really want to talk about this but I will anyway because it will help me get it off my chest. I was sexually assaulted as a child; a bully made me kiss his penis and I did because I was afraid for my safety. I bottled it up because I was afraid I would be ridiculed as gay. I'm probably pansexual with a strong preference towards woman but I'm sure that preference is mostly cultural. I was traumatized that I wasn't able to greave that abuse or tell anyone about it. I think a part of it was culturally ingrained homophobia. I would repress that memory whenever it would bubble to the surface but no longer.
