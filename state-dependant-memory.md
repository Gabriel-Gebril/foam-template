# State Dependant Memory
A memory phenomenon where people remember information if their physical or mental state is the same at time of encoding and time of recall. That dependent memory is most commonly associated with psychoactive drugs like caffeine, alcohol and marijuana. However, while that's the most obvious form of state dependant memory; organic state of consciousness such as mood trigger the same effect.
While State Dependant memory might seem similar to [[context-dependent]] memory , they are in fact different.
