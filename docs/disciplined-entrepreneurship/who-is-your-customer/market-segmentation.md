# Market Segmentation
- Brainstorm a wide array of potential customers and markets for your business.
- Narrow your list down to your top 6-12 markets.
- Gather primary market research on your top 6-12 markets.

## What Single Necessary and Sufficient Condition for a Business?
**A Paying customer!**
A business cannot be defined as a product, because if nobody buys your product, you simply do not have a business. The marketplace is the final arbiter of monetary success.
However, just because you have a paying customer doesn't mean you have a good business. For a sustainable business, you need to gain enough customers paying enough money within a relatively short period of time do that you do not run out of capital but instead become profitable.
Therefore, you shouldn't start by building a product. Instead, you should take a customer-driven approach by finding an unmet need and building your business around it.
## Create a New Market That You Will Dominate
- Being a "me-too" company is much more difficult in an existing market because it is more difficult to gain ground on entrenched competition with limited resources.
- To create this company in a newly defined market space, focus on a target customer. A target customer is a group of potential customers who share many characteristics and who would all have a similar reason to buy a particular product.
- Must work to identify and understand customers through primary market research, because relying on "educated assumptions" or third party analysis is guess work when you are creating new markets.
- Once you have established a foothold within a group, you will have enough resources to expand to an adjacent market.

## Step 1A: Brainstorm
- Start by brainstorming a wide array of market opportunities. Include even the "crazy ideas" 
  - Talking about your idea or tech with potential customers will give clear and accurate feedback for market segmentation. Ideally you are a potential customer yourself and have a deep understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.
- Identify potential industries for the idea. list who might benefit in each industry. Focus on end users.
- Identify the different tasks your end user performs.

## Step 1B: Narrow
1. Is the target customer well funded?
2. Is the target customer readily accessible to our sales force?
3. Does the target customer have a compelling reason to buy?
4. Can you today, with the help of partners, deliver a whole product?
5. Is there entrenched competition that could block you?
6. If you win this segment, can you leverage it to enter additional segments?
7. Is the market consistent with the values, passions and goals of the founding team?

## Step 1C: Primary Market Research
- Talk directly with customers and observing customers
- Because we are identifying a new market google searches will be increasingly useless. If a firm has already done a market research report then it's probably too late. Someone has beaten us to the punch.
- The vast majority of our info is going to come from interaction with potential customers about their situation, pain points, opportunities and market information.
### How to talk with potential customers. 
A few key factors in collecting accurate info:
- You must have a high level of intellectual curiosity
- You must be fearless about getting on the phone, in the car, or on a plane to pursue this information.
- You must have an ability to listen and get people to talk.
- You must be open0minded and unbiased, and never presuppose a solution (inquiry, not advocacy)
- You must have the ability to explain what the essence of your proposed offering might look like while also being flexible
- You must have time and patience to devote to this important step.
Here are some caveats when conducting primary market research
1. You do not have "the answer" for your potential customers and their needs.
2. Your potential customers do not have "the answer" for you
3. Talk with potential customers in "inquiry" mode, not "advocacy/sales" mode. Listen to what they have to say, and don't try to get them to buy anything.

## Organizing Your Research
1. End User: Who specifically would be using your product?
2. Application: What would the end user be using your product for? What is the task that would be dramatically improved by your new venture?
3. Benefits: What is the actual value that the end user would gain from the use of your new product?
4. Lead Customers: Who are the most influential customers that others look to for thought leadership and adoption of the new tech?
5. Market characteristics: What about this market would help or hinder the adoption of the new tech?
6. Partners/Players: Which companies will you need to work with to provide a solution that integrates into the customer's workflow?
7. Size of the Market: How many potential customers exist if you achieve 100% market penetration?
8. Competition
9. Complementary Asset Required: What else does your customer need in order to get the "full solution", that is, to get full functionality from your product? You will likely need to bundle your product with products from other manufacturers so that your customers can easily buy your product and have full functionality. At the very least, you will need to identify which other products your customer will need to buy to user your product.
It is easiest to organize this information in a matrix like the example below:
