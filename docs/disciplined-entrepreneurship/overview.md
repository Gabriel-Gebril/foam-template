# Disciplined Entrepreneurship
These notes are adapted from a book by the same name which seeks to be an integrated toolbox for building enterprises. I wouldn't usually call my approach to thing "disciplined" but I think starting from a foundation of discipline and then messing around with the ideas in a undisciplined way later will be easier than the other way around.

The book outlines 24 steps to follow that lead to successful enterprises. The 24 steps fall into six themes.
