# Computer Science
Ahhhh, home sweet home I guess. This was what I got a degree in so obviously this topic has taken up a lot of real estate in my brain. Don't worry it used to pay rent, it promises it will one day pay rent again. We shall see.

## Goals
- Creation: I want to be able to create using this knowledge. Applications, websites, servers. I want these creations to serve myself and those I care about.
- [Teaching](web-dev-2022/teach.md): I have gaining considerable knowledge in this area. I want to be able to share that knowledge with others.

## Subtopics
- [[algorithms]]
- Programming languages
- Backend Plumbing
- Frontend Frameworking
