# Compassionate Curiosity
Mostly used to in field of conflict resolution this #concept allows us to use our prefrontal cortex instead of our lizard brain when engaged in activities that might otherwise trigger our fight, flight, freeze response.
## What is Compassionate Curiosity?
Compassionate Curiosity as a #procedure is when feeling your amygdala triggering your fight, flight, freeze response you take a step back and approach the situation from a compassionate angle and ask questions to better understand the person that has triggered your lizardic response. This requires that one suspends judgement and creates a safe space for all parties to be vulnerable.
