# Freedom

I sit here staring at my calendar app trying to find a solution to what I want to do day in and day out. The thing is I don't want to trade the tyrant of corporation to a tiny tyrant of my own creation. There are things I want to do that will benefit from routine and schedule but what is the line between freedom and subjugation to my own mind?

I once tried to calculate every aspect of my life. Schedule every detail, weigh every grain of rice, plan every detail, calculate every outcome. This made me profoundly unhappy, any deviation was an affront to myself and "what I was trying to build". If I skipped a day at the gym I would berate myself, if I ate a donut at the office I would guilt myself and the list goes on. I thought I was giving myself bitter medicine, that I was lazy and gluttonous and the only way I could overcome that reality was pure order.

That turned out to be a lie I told myself after buying into a TON of propaganda surrounding Silicon valley. I found my entire personality change in the matter of a few years. I now find myself staring at my calendar app in my childhood bedroom thinking what would I have done for little Gabe if instead of "him" being "me" I treated him like a brother I absolutely wanted to see achieve his goals. I don't think I would have treated him as a tyrant might have treated a child; I imagine I would want to give him a playground to do anything he wants in and watch his growth. I feel like I stole away that child's freedom and I want more than anything to give it back to him. 

Didn't he want to be a Minecraft youtuber? Didn't he want to make videogames? Didn't he want to be a cook? It's easy for me to say I let him try, but I didn't fight for him nearly as much as I should have. I solemnly promise to make that child smile, I want to make him the King of the Pirates like he always wanted to be. 

Alright captain, now what are your orders?
