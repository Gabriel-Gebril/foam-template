# Tagging
This document describes the tagging philosophy I am following right now.
## Track Function not Topic
- **By action**: What actions have you taken (or will you take) with this note?
- **By deliverable**: What have you used (or will you use) this note to deliver?
- **By Kind**:
  1. Ambition
  2. Argument
  3. Analysis
  4. Procedure: Step by step how to do something.
  5. Process: A series of procedures.
  6. Concept: An idea of what something is or how it works
  7. Collection
  8. Structure: The way something is built, arranged or organized.
  9. Classification: Systematic arrangement in groups or categories according to established criteria
  10. Principle: A basic truth or theory : an idea that forms the basis of something.
  11. Fact: something that truly exists or happens: something that has actual existence. A true piece of information.
