# Goals
This page will be a living document that contains information on how to set goals as well as a hub for goals of the past and present.

## How to set Goals
There is definitely a lot of junk to sift through in this area. Honestly, I'm not sure what the best advice on this topic is. CGPGrey has a great video on [[theming]] that I've kind of adapted to a node of information. Then there is the idea of SMART vs VAPID goals that again I got out of a CGPGrey video [[ways-to-maximize-misery]]. SMART is especially one I've heard about since elementary school and any information given to 9 year olds should be looked at with a gain of salt. Both of these goal setting techniques feel a bit inadequate by themselves especially when put in the wider context of achieving goals on the scale of lifetimes. 
One area of knowledge that might inform this answer is that of [[gamification]]. Growing up playing lots of video games this might be the best way for me to achieve goals since I've literally been training my brain to operate under the the rules of game design my whole life. Could achieving a goal be similar to beating a boss in Dark Souls?
